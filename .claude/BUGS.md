## 2026-05-27 — PLAN_PHASE_2C.md 2C.6 rule-count arithmetic error

Discovered by: implementer during 2C.6 execution
Location: PLAN_PHASE_2C.md § 2C.6, line 380 ("this commit lands 13 rules, not 15")
Severity: low
Observation: The 2C.6 section table enumerates 6 (value-anomaly) + 5
(geographic) + 8 (threat-intel composites, of which 2 are triaged
out) = 17 rules after triage. The plan body says "13 rules" and the
header on the threat-intel section says "(~4)". Both numbers
disagree with the actual table contents. Implementation lands 17
rules to match the table; reviewer panel verified the arithmetic and
approved.
Suggested action: when 2C closes, refresh the rule-count summary in
PLAN_PHASE_2C.md to reflect actual 17 (and update the batch-summary
"~63" total downstream — actual is 62 at the end of 2C.6, will be
greater at end of 2C.7).
